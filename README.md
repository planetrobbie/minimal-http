A minimal http web server in Go.

For dynamic reloading install Modd

`go install github.com/cortesi/modd/cmd/modd@latest`

And launch it within this directory

`modd`

Beware that if your code doesn't compile modd will stick with the previous version. It can be confusing. If you have any doubt just restart modd.
